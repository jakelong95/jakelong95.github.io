					During my career as a student at Iowa State, I have learned as much about software engineering as possible through the classes I have taken.
					During my college career I also took several general education classes to expand my perspective beyond just Software Engineering and to improve my non-technical skills.
					These classes will give me insight into different problems facing the world, and will allow me to take these into account when designing software solutions
					that will reach a wide audience of users.
