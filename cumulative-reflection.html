				<div class="panel-heading"><h4>Prepared to Solve Problems</h4></div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					Iowa State has prepared me to solve problems by having me take challenging classes that required me to think about my
					solutions instead of just quickly writing down some code and hoping it worked. This extends beyond just solving simple problems, as
					my classes have prepared me to develop larger scale software that involves multiple sytems by giving projects that can't be solved in a single solution.
					I have worked on projects that require client-server architecture, and for my senior design project we will be using a distributed systems approach.
				</div>

			<div class="panel panel-default">
				<div class="panel-heading"><h4>Group Worker</h4></div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					I've always enjoyed working in groups, I like working with people. My classes have prepared me to work in groups because a lot of the work
					done in classes is group work, requireing collaboration while writing software and solving problems.
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="panel panel-default">
				<div class="panel-heading"><h4>Ethics</h4></div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					Iowa State did not teach me anything about ethics.
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="panel panel-default">
				<div class="panel-heading"><h4>Contemporary Issues</h4></div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					Iowa State is inconsistent about contemporary issues. There are some classes that handle this subject well, but there are also those that do not. One such class that does not do well on contemporary
					issues is our class on databases. Nothing about big data or current technologies are tought, and the professor doesn't use tools that are actually used in industry. This has been brought up to the faculty
					multiple times, but they aren't changing anything.
				</div>

			<div class="panel panel-default">
				<div class="panel-heading"><h4>Lifelong Learning</h4></div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					I am prepared to be a lifelong learner because I enjoy learning new things. New technologies, new ways of solving problems, anything really.
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="panel panel-default">
				<div class="panel-heading"><h4>Outside Resources</h4></div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					The only outside resources I used during classes were API documentation and forums such as Stack Overflow.
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="panel panel-default">
				<div class="panel-heading"><h4>Learning On My Own</h4></div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					I have always tought myself things outside of the classroom to apply my skills and knowledge. I do this by working on personal projects and competition sites like hacker rank.
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="panel panel-default">
				<div class="panel-heading"><h4>What Would I Change?</h4></div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					I would have gone out of my way to teach myself important topics such as big data and databases, areas that Iowa State does not cover well.
