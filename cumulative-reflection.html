				<div class="panel-body">
					Iowa State has prepared me to solve problems by having me take challenging classes that required me to think about my
					solutions instead of just quickly writing down some code and hoping it worked. This extends beyond just solving simple problems, as
					my classes have prepared me to develop larger scale software that involves multiple sytems by giving projects that can't be solved in a single solution.
					I have worked on projects that require client-server architecture, and for my senior design project we will be using a distributed systems approach.

				<div class="panel-heading"><h4>Group Worker</h4></div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					I've always enjoyed working in groups, I like working with people. My classes have prepared me to work in groups because a lot of the work
					done in classes is group work, requireing collaboration while writing software and solving problems.

				<div class="panel-heading"><h4>Lifelong Learning</h4></div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					I am prepared to be a lifelong learner because I enjoy learning new things. New technologies, new ways of solving problems, anything really.

				<div class="panel-heading"><h4>What Would I Change?</h4></div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					I would not change any part of my undergraduate experience because I feel that I have learned the skills required to achieve my goals.
